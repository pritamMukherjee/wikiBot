# wikipedia api example
This is an html approach of using the wikipedia api. The html code uses the wikipedia api to find stuff that is in wikipedia. It is made only using html css and javascript. It is easy to use and comments has been added in necessary places so following the code would not be a problem. You can edit the code.
This code gives you a ready made option to incorporate the wikipedia api in your code on the go. Not much changes  would be needed.




Keep in mind a few things

1) This code used the wikipedia api as it is and does not perform any check on the json data that wikipedia sends back to the code

2)It uses AJAX to get the job done

3) Dependencies are jquery, though bootstrap is used it is just for beautification.

4) Do not do too many calls otherwise wikipedia may block you. Dont ask me how, I dont know.


Have fun and keep coding.
